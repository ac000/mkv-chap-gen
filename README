Overview
========

mkv-chap-gen is a simple utility to create Matroska simple format chapter
files of the form

    CHAPTERxx=
    CHAPTERxxNAME=

e.g

    CHAPTER01=00:00:00.000
    CHAPTER01NAME=Chapter 1
    CHAPTER02=00:09:30.480
    CHAPTER02NAME=Chapter 2
    CHAPTER03=00:23:16.040
    CHAPTER03NAME=Chapter 3
    CHAPTER04=00:31:21.000
    CHAPTER04NAME=Chapter 4

To do this it takes the JSON output of dvd_info
(https://github.com/beandog/dvd_info) for the required title. e,g

    $ dvd_info -j -t 1 | mkv-chap-gen

or e.g

    $ dvd_info -j -t 5 /path/to/iso | mkv-chap-gen > movie-chapters.txt
